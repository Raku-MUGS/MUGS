% TODO Lists

Work on MUGS and the MUGS ecosystem is very open-ended, with many different
places to spend time and effort.  It would be easy to get lost in a seemingly
never-ending list if all the todos were kept in a single file; I've thus split
the todo items by work area into separate files.  (These may eventually be
moved to an issue tracker, but for now it's not clear how that tracker would be
best organized long term, so for now just using files.)
