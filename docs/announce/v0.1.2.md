# MUGS 0.1.2 Released!

The [Raku-MUGS org](https://github.com/Raku-MUGS) is proud to present our
second development release on the way to our next major milestone.  This
release includes many changes since 0.1.1 to address feedback from our users in
`#mugs` in Freenode IRC, but the majority of the milestone work is yet to be
done.  :-)


## Packaging

MUGS is available in both source and package form, via these methods:


### `zef`

To simply play with what's already there, use `zef` to install all of `MUGS`
from the `zef/fez` ecosystem.  To prevent failure due to an **unneeded**
transitive dependency that does not exist on all systems, use the following
command:

```
zef install --exclude="pq:ver<5>:from<native>" MUGS
```

**NOTE 1:** If you're having trouble with installing via `zef`, please take
a look at our [installation guide](../howto/install-mugs.md), which has
additional troubleshooting hints.

**NOTE 2:** In this release, MUGS-UI-WebSimple is known to be broken when
installed by `zef`, because it cannot find its HTML templates.  If you would
like to try this UI, please use the Source Repos method below.


### Source Repos

The source for all released MUGS repos can be found in the
[Raku-MUGS org on GitHub](https://github.com/Raku-MUGS).  Note that if you are
working on a UI repo, you will probably want to install MUGS with `zef` as
described above to satisfy dependencies, or at least install both
[MUGS-Core](https://github.com/Raku-MUGS/MUGS-Core) and
[MUGS-Games](https://github.com/Raku-MUGS/MUGS-Games).


### Docker

MUGS does not yet have prebuilt Docker packages, but each source repo includes
two `Dockerfile` scripts.  The main `Dockerfile` simply installs the relevant
MUGS libraries, scripts, and resources on top of a `rakudo-star` official image
and creates a default MUGS identity universe.  `Dockerfile.test` builds on that
by also installing test identities into the default universe.


## Improvements

...


## Contributions

This development release is largely the work of Geoffrey Broadwell (`japhb` on
Freenode and [GitHub](https://github.com/japhb)), based on excellent feedback
on the [0.1.1 release](v0.1.1.md) from the denizens of `#mugs` on Freenode IRC.

If you'd like to contribute to future releases, please take a look at
[our CONTRIBUTING doc](../CONTRIBUTING.md); we'd love to have you!


## Contacting Us

We are on the `#mugs` channel on Freenode IRC; please come and ask questions or
offer suggestions!  Please note that we do not yet have 24-hour round-the-clock
coverage, so please stick around and allow some time for response if you don't
get one immediately.

If you are interested in the more general world of game development on Raku,
we are also on the `#raku-gamedev` channel, also on Freenode IRC.


## Future

The next few milestones have been sketched out in our
[release roadmap](../todo/release-roadmap.md).  Future releases are of
course subject to change, but the most likely changes are deferral of iffy
changes or incomplete features that are holding up release of finished work.


## Thank You

THANK YOU to the ever-helpful `#mugs` crew, to everyone who worked on the many
[projects on which MUGS is built](../design/built-with.md), to the awesome and
supportive Raku community, and of course to Larry, Damian, Jonathan, and all
the other Raku designers for creating a language that brings joy day after day!
