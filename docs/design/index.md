**NOTE: If you would like to contribute to MUGS, please read and follow the
[Coding Standards](coding-standards.md) before sending your pull request.**


This directory contains the core MUGS design documents, plus less formal design
notes and sketches.  Note that some may be out of date or NYI (Not Yet
Implemented).  If you notice any of these, feel free to make sure there is an
open issue to address this.
